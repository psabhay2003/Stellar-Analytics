# Stellar-Analytics
Stellar Analytics is a national level cosmic data analysis competition conducted by IIT (BHU) Varanasi.
The objective is to create a custom "habitability index" of exoplanets and classify them into three categories:
Potentially Habitable: Conditions conducive to liquid water
Marginally Habitable: Extreme but not impossible conditions for life
Non-Habitable: No realistic possibility of life as we know it
We  can either build a Machine Learning model or adopt a Statistical model approach to create a “Habitability Index” using features derived from the datasets or directly from the datasets.
The task also involves cleaning and preprocessing the raw data, deriving meaningful features such as the ESI and others (which can be derived from the dataset) that might be useful for the custom Habitability Index, addressing missing or noisy values with well-justified methods, and visualizing the relationships between features using correlation matrix.
