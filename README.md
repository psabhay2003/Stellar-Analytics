# Stellar-Analytics
Stellar Analytics was a national-level cosmic data analysis competition organized by ****IIT (BHU) Varanasi****.
The objective is to create a custom "habitability index" of exoplanets and classify them into three categories:

- Potentially Habitable: Conditions conducive to liquid water.
* Marginally Habitable: Extreme but not impossible conditions for life.
+ Non-Habitable: No realistic possibility of life as we know it.

We  can either build a Machine Learning model or adopt a Statistical model approach to create a “Habitability Index” using features derived from or directly from the datasets.
The task also involves cleaning and preprocessing the raw data, deriving meaningful features such as the ESI and others (which can be derived from the dataset) that might be useful for the custom Habitability Index, addressing missing or noisy values with well-justified methods, and visualizing the relationships between features using a correlation matrix.

Also, I have attached a copy of the mail confirming my successful qualification for the final round of the event. Unfortunately, I could not participate in the final round because the dates clashed with my mid-semester examination schedule.
